<p>This is not a post about a web-version of the popular racing game title ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed">Need for Speed</a>’ by EA, although I love that game and I have wasted too many hours racing through dark cities and endless highways, followed by a police squadron. This article is about something else: The speed of the internet and specifically the speed at which your website loads.</p>

<p>Equally exciting, but far more important, as website speed is a big success factor. More than 20 years after Neilson Norman Group posted an article with <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/">a similar title</a> and similar content. Althought the online world has changed significantly in the meantime, this subject is still relevant. Allow me to explain why.</p>

<h2 id="impatient-visitors">Impatient visitors</h2>

<p>Research on e-commerce websites shows that <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/seo-for-ecommerce-websites/">40 percent</a> of consumers will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site. The avarage loading time of websites is currently <a href="https://research.hubspot.com/reports/does-your-website-make-the-grade">3.7 seconds</a>. Mobile traffic has an increased <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8553/network-latency">latency</a> of <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/phame/live/7/post/83/measuring_wikipedia_page_load_times/">about 200ms</a>, making your website even slower. We also know that the percentage mobile traffic is growing steadily. This means that already OVER 50% of the websites fails to render within three seconds (and is losing visitors). As a consequence of the rising percentage of mobile traffic this number is expected to only increase.</p>

<h2 id="better-ranking">Better ranking</h2>

<p>A slow website has another problem: It might not reach that first page or position in Google. Google <a href="https://yoast.com/site-speed-tools-suggestions/">penalizes</a> slow websites. They have been doing this <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-says-page-speed-ranking-factor-use-mobile-page-speed-mobile-sites-upcoming-months-250874">since 2010</a>. From <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-speed-update-page-speed-will-become-ranking-factor-mobile-search-289904">July 2018</a> speed will actually be a ranking factor in mobile search too. This makes improving the speed of your website an important search engine optimization for all platforms.</p>

<h2 id="improved-conversion">Improved conversion</h2>

<p>Examples <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/page-load-time-conversion-rates">show</a> that speedy websites have more conversion than slow websites. On a fast website visitors will be <a href="https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/wpo/2014/04/web-page-speed-affect-conversions-infographic/">more likely</a> to fill out an order form, enter contact details or subscribe to an email newsletter. Making your website faster can easily result in a <a href="http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2010/07/01/the-best-graphs-of-velocity/">20% conversion increase</a>.</p>

<h2 id="improved-ux">Improved UX</h2>

<p>Slow websites makes visitors frustrated and angry. That negative feeling is <a href="https://velocitize.com/2017/03/27/how-site-speed-impacts-your-seo-and-ux/">associated</a> with your brand. People <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/">remember</a> a slow website. A quick website, however, means a better experience and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/">more engagement</a>. Quicker page loads mean better UX.</p>

<h2 id="speed-matters">Speed matters</h2>

<p>As you can see, speed is a big factor in the success of your website. Your website will rank better, have more visitors, more conversion and a better experience. The value of your website is directly related to its speed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlbJKOWEPEM">Speed really matters.</a>. <a href="https://vimeo.com/345725942">test</a></p>

<h2 id="a-real-life-example">A real-life example</h2>

<p>Let us look at at a responsive retina-ready one-page website, with custom fonts, a lot of imagery and javascript, that looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/speedexample.jpg" style="display: block;"><img src="/uploads/speedexample_pattern.png" style="display: block;" /></a></p>

<p>This page is only 1 megabyte large and load in 0.6 seconds, as reported by <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GT Metrix</a>. Note that this means it still requires 4 seconds on 3G, according to the <a href="https://testmysite.withgoogle.com/intl/gb-int">Google mobile speed tester for 3G</a>. Luckily, most people surf on 4G today, but is shows that websites are not easily fast enough.</p>

<h2 id="anlyzing-and-optimizing-speed">Anlyzing and optimizing speed</h2>

<p>You can get some valuable advice from independent speed analysis tools like <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GT Metrix</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Google Lighthouse</a> and the <a href="https://testmysite.withgoogle.com/intl/gb-int">Google mobile speed tester for 3G</a>. They will give you the numbers and tell you exactly how to make your web page faster. Need more help? Do not hesitate to <a href="/contact">ask</a>.</p>
