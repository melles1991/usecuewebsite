<p>After twelve years of using the same logo, it was time for a redesign. An opportunity to do it right.</p>

<p>When I started Usecue in 2007 I needed a logo. I already loved typography so I chose for a typographic Swiss approach. Instead of choosing for Helvetica, I chose for the Open Sans, bacause it was open source. I experimented with font weights and finally came to a logo that consisted of the lowercase words ‘usecue web development’, where ‘usecue’ was bold (weight: 700) and ‘web development’ thin (weight: 300). Although it was visually pleasing, there was no real philosophy behind it. Finally, after twelve years of using this logo, I found the time for a redesign.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-brand">The new brand</h2>

<p>I wrote an article called ‘<a href="/blog/a-tribute-to-the-web/">A tribute to the web</a>’. It outlines what the redesign/new brand aims to communicate: respect for the web. The new brand consists of three principles: the underlined u, the color blue and the font Times New Roman. The first two represent the term ‘usecue’ and the latter represents the absence of form. Let me explain…</p>

<h2 id="the-underlined-u-and-the-color-blue">The underlined ‘u’ and the color blue</h2>

<p>The underlined lowercase ‘u’ is often seen on underline buttons in a WYSIWYG editor. Microsoft Word uses this symbol too for the same purpose and it can therefore be considered to have the universal meaning: ‘underline’. The word ‘usecue’ means <a href="/blog/usecues-also-known-as-affordances/">product affordance</a>: a characteristic of an object that indicates how it should be used. In the <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">early days</a> HTML pages consisted only of text with hyperlinks. The way to interact with these pages was to click on one of these hyperlinks. The hyperlinks where recognizable by two characteristics: an underline and their bright blue color. Therefore, the underline and the color blue were the first usecues of the web.</p>

<h2 id="times-new-roman">Times New Roman</h2>

<p>Any font choice would be a design statement. An implicit expression of form instead of meaning. There was only one font I could think of that had more meaning than form (in this context): Times New Roman, the ultimate default serif of the web. The ‘absence of form’ is not something you would expect to fit a web development company. However, I mostly work for and with graphic designers, where I build their designs. So in my case it makes perfect sense. It even reflects my work process.</p>
