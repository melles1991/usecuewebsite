This company (Transactility, Inc) from Florida contacted me to help them with the development of their new Jekyll website. They had created a basic layout and I rebuild and fine-tuned their website in Jekyll. The site has a great [Google Lighthouse score](/blog/how-to-get-a-100-google-lighthouse-score/) and can be managed fully in the CloudCannon CMS. The first page is quite visually pleasing, but weighs only 260kb.
