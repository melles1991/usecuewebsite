I"<p>I have written a three step <a href="http://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/">Getting Started manual for Jekyll</a>. The manual can be followed by anyone (no command line needed). Everything you need to do, can be done in a browser and a text editor.</p>

<p>What is Jekyll? Jekyll is the most popular static site generator available. A lot of big companies, like Google and Netflix use Jekyll for their website development. The Obama campaign (fundraising) website was <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators/">built</a> with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Why should you use Jekyll/a static site generator? Static sites are quick to develop, simple to adjust, hosting is cheaper and they can be easily optimized for SEO and speed. As a bonus, static websites are extremely stable and they can handle a huge amount of visitors.</p>

<p>So do you want a next-generation website? Follow the <a href="http://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/">Geting Started manual for Jekyll</a>! Your first Jekyll site is only minutes away!</p>
