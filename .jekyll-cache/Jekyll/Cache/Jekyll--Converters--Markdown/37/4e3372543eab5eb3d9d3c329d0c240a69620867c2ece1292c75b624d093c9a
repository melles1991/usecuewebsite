I"µ<p>In 2008 Google promised us websites that would load as quick as shooting a potato through a slicer with explosives. In other words, in one or two tenths of a second, or as I like to call it: â€˜instantlyâ€™.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nCgQDjiotG0"><img src="/uploads/instantly.gif" alt="Video of Chrome loading instantly and beating the potato gun." /></a><em>Video of Chrome loading instantly and beating the potato gun.</em></p>

<p>Their campaign revolved around the introduction of v8, a new Javascript engine. This turned out to be a game changer and made Chrome significantly faster than any other browser at the time. The campaign was a big hit and Chrome (eventually) became the most used browser world wide, mostly due to this competitive advantage.</p>

<p>In their campaign video they used the website <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com">allrecipes.com</a>. I was curious to see how fast it loads today. We could ask <a href="https://web.dev">Lighthouse</a>, but Lighthouse simulates a slow 3G connection, so I asked <a href="https://www.pingdom.com">Pingdom</a>. Pingdom reported that the current website of allrecipes.com loads in <a href="/uploads/allrecipespingdom.png">4.8 seconds</a>. That is far from instantly. Their website has either become much slower during the past 11 years or we were looking at a preloaded website or both.</p>

<p>From the video description we can read the website was preloaded (they used a local version). However, with Googles current focus on speed, I was wondering: can a website load in under 0.2 seconds over the internet? In other words: could a website load instantly and beat the potato gun? The answer is YES. According to Pingdom, this website loads in <a href="/uploads/usecuepingdom.png">0.1 seconds</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This website loads in 0.1 seconds!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What it requires? First of all you need a really low TTFB (time to first byte). This can be achieved by serving static code (using a site generator or cache plugin) in combination with a server that is geographically close to you. Ofcourse you also need a small page (with heavily compressed images and no jQuery). Finally, to get the best performance, you should use very little to no Javascript. This will give your site a low TTI (time to interactive) and <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about?hl=nl-NL&amp;utm_source=PSI&amp;utm_medium=incoming-link&amp;utm_campaign=PSI">FID</a> (first input delay).</p>

<p>But why would you want all this? What is the use of beating the potato gun? I am writing this post on a mobile phone with a spotty internet connection. A fast website loads here in a few seconds, a slow website takes forever or does not load at all. Fast websites are more accesible. Google acknowledges this too and <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html?m=1">prefers</a> to show fast loading websites in its search result. Fast websites rank higher. It <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/">has been proven</a> that fast websites have a higher conversion rate as well. Fast websites are simply more effective.</p>

<p>Do you want your website to be more effective? Make it load instantly. Donâ€™t know how? No problem. I know <a href="/blog/how-to-get-a-100-google-lighthouse-score/">how to get a 100% Google Lighthouse score</a> and I love to help. Just give me a call.</p>
