title: Need for Speed on the web
---

This is not a post about a web-version of the popular racing game title '[Need for Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed)' by EA. I love that game and I have wasted too many hours racing through dark cities and endless highways, followed by a squadron of police cars. This article is about something else: The speed of the internet and specifically the speed at which your website loads.

Equally exciting, but far more important, as website speed is a big success factor. More than 20 years after Neilson Norman Group posted an article with [the same title](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/) as this one, this is still relevant. Allow me to explain why.

## Impatient visitors

Research on e-commerce websites shows that [40 percent](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/seo-for-ecommerce-websites/) of consumers will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site. We also know mobile traffic is growing in percentage. Mobile traffic [causes](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/phame/live/7/post/83/measuring_wikipedia_page_load_times/) has an increased [latency](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8553/network-latency) of about 200ms, making your website even slower. The avarage loading time of websites is currently [about 3.7 seconds](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/does-your-website-make-the-grade). This means that OVER 50% of the websites is failing to render within three seconds and this number is expected to only increase with the rise of mobile traffic. These slow websites lose a lot of visitors while loading.

## Influence ranking

A slow website has another problem: It might not reach that first page or position in Google. Google [penalizes](https://yoast.com/site-speed-tools-suggestions/) slow websites. They do this [since 2010](https://searchengineland.com/google-says-page-speed-ranking-factor-use-mobile-page-speed-mobile-sites-upcoming-months-250874). From [July 2018](https://searchengineland.com/google-speed-update-page-speed-will-become-ranking-factor-mobile-search-289904) speed will actually be a ranking factor in mobile search too. This makes improving your websites speed an important search engine optimization for all platforms. Google simply favors fast website over slow ones, and has been doing so since 2010.

## Improve conversion

Examples [show](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/page-load-time-conversion-rates) that speedy websites have more conversion than slow websites. Visitors will be [significantly more likely](https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/wpo/2014/04/web-page-speed-affect-conversions-infographic/) to fill out an order form, enter contact details or subscribe to an email newsletter on a fast loading website. Making your website faster can easily result in a [20% conversion increase](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2010/07/01/the-best-graphs-of-velocity/).

## Improve UX

Slow websites makes visitors frustrated and angry. That negative feeling is [associated](https://velocitize.com/2017/03/27/how-site-speed-impacts-your-seo-and-ux/) with your brand. People will [remember](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/) a slow website. A quick websites, however, means a better experience, thus [more engagement](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/). Quicker page loads mean better UX.

## Speed matters

As you can see, speed is a big factor in the success of your website. Your website will rank better, have more visitors, more conversion and a better experience. The value of your website is directly related to its speed. [Speed really matters.](https://www.youtube.com/watch/OlbJKOWEPEM)

## A real life example

Let us look at at a responsive retina-ready one-page website, with custom fonts, a lot of imagery and javascript, that looks like this:

This page is only 1 megabyte large and load in [0.6 seconds](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/pink-fjord.cloudvent.net/trXljyaE), as reported by [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/). Note that this means it still requires 5 seconds on 3G, according to the [Google mobile speed tester for 3G](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com/intl/gb-int). Luckily, most people surf on 4G today. But it shows that websites are not easily speedy enough.

## Doing it yourself

You can get some valuable advice from independent speed analysis tools like [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/), [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) and the [Google mobile speed tester for 3G](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com/intl/gb-int). They will give you the numbers and tell you exactly how to make your web page faster. Still need help? Do not hesitate to [ask](/contact).
