title: The need for speed on the web
---

This is not a post about a web-version of the popular racing game title '[Need for Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed)' by EA, although I love that game and I have wasted too many hours racing through dark cities and endless highways, followed by a police squadron. This article is about something else: The speed of the internet and specifically the speed at which your website loads.

Equally exciting, but far more important, as website speed is a big success factor. More than 20 years after Neilson Norman Group posted an article with [a similar title](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/) and similar content. Althought the online world has changed significantly in the meantime, this subject is still relevant. Allow me to explain why.

## Impatient visitors

Research on e-commerce websites shows that [40 percent](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/seo-for-ecommerce-websites/) of consumers will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site. The avarage loading time of websites is currently [3.7 seconds](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/does-your-website-make-the-grade). Mobile traffic [has](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/phame/live/7/post/83/measuring_wikipedia_page_load_times/) an increased [latency](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8553/network-latency) of about 200ms, making your website even slower. We also know that the percentage mobile traffic is growing steadily. This means that already OVER 50% of the websites fails to render within three seconds (and is losing visitors). A a consequence of the rising percentage of mobile traffic. this number is expected to only increase.

## Better ranking

A slow website has another problem: It might not reach that first page or position in Google. Google [penalizes](https://yoast.com/site-speed-tools-suggestions/) slow websites. They have been doing this [since 2010](https://searchengineland.com/google-says-page-speed-ranking-factor-use-mobile-page-speed-mobile-sites-upcoming-months-250874). From [July 2018](https://searchengineland.com/google-speed-update-page-speed-will-become-ranking-factor-mobile-search-289904) speed will actually be a ranking factor in mobile search too. This makes improving the speed of your website an important search engine optimization for all platforms.

## Improved conversion

Examples [show](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/page-load-time-conversion-rates) that speedy websites have more conversion than slow websites. On a fast website visitors will be [more likely](https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/wpo/2014/04/web-page-speed-affect-conversions-infographic/) to fill out an order form, enter contact details or subscribe to an email newsletter. Making your website faster can easily result in a [20% conversion increase](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2010/07/01/the-best-graphs-of-velocity/).

## Improved UX

Slow websites makes visitors frustrated and angry. That negative feeling is [associated](https://velocitize.com/2017/03/27/how-site-speed-impacts-your-seo-and-ux/) with your brand. People [remember](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/) a slow website. A quick website, however, means a better experience and [more engagement](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/). Quicker page loads mean better UX.

## Speed matters

As you can see, speed is a big factor in the success of your website. Your website will rank better, have more visitors, more conversion and a better experience. The value of your website is directly related to its speed. [Speed really matters.](https://www.youtube.com/watch/OlbJKOWEPEM)

## A real-life example

Let us look at at a responsive retina-ready one-page website, with custom fonts, a lot of imagery and javascript, that looks like this:

This page is only 1 megabyte large and load in [0.6 seconds](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/pink-fjord.cloudvent.net/trXljyaE), as reported by [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/). Note that this means it still requires 5 seconds on 3G, according to the [Google mobile speed tester for 3G](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com/intl/gb-int). Luckily, most people surf on 4G today, but is shows that websites are not easily fast enough.

## Anlyzing and optimzing speed

You can get some valuable advice from independent speed analysis tools like [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/), [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) and the [Google mobile speed tester for 3G](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com/intl/gb-int). They will give you the numbers and tell you exactly how to make your web page faster. Neeed more help? Do not hesitate to [ask](/contact).
