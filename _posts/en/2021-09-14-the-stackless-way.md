title: The Stackless Way
---

The Stackless Way wants to give beginners a gradual path from simple HTML into more power without encountering frameworks or build tools as a barrier. It shares my conviction that 'there are no shortcuts' and '[you need to master your sword](/blog/code-warriors)'.

## Good old HTML

Although Daniel Kehoe, who inspired me to write something about Stackless, disagrees, you can (and should) use standard HTML elements. He proposes to use custom HTML elements that are enriched with javascript, but I am a purist: loading unknown code from a package manager is not plain and Stackless enough for me.

## Vanilla JS

Javascript without a framework is also referred to as Vanilla JS. I can explain why it is cool, but [this website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210824231100/http://vanilla-js.com/) does a better job. Note that this whole website is written in a 'tongue-in-cheek' style.

## Plain CSS

I use plain CSS. No postprocessors, no fancy alternative CSS flavours, like SCSS or SASS. The advantage? The same as for the above (HTML and JS). You only need to learn web standards. Nothing more and nothing less (pun intended).

## Remarks

CSS might need help, [says Daniel Kehoe](https://tutorials.yax.com/articles/the-yax-way/2.html). I agree, but I also think that HTML needs help, JS needs help and CSS needs help. That is exactly what frameworks are for. Frameworks, however, come at a price we might not want to pay. The Stackless Way wants you to learn to work with the basics, instead of learning the newest hottest shortcuts every few months.
