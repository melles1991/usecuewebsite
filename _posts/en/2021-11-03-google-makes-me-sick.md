title: Google makes me sick
---

I posted a critical comment under this Keynote "What's new in Chrome". I got deleted immediately by the Google team, which made me write the comment below instead. But first some context. We are talking about [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2U9-R-OJs).

"Why is my reaction gone? What is it that you do not want people to read?

I said something critical about Google losing income due to the massive amount of privacy rules, ad blockers and browsers blocking cookies and cross site requests by default. I said that this was the real reason why Google is changing its profiling strategy. They do not really care about privacy. The other thing I said is that this video is having a childish design on purpose (simplified look, bright colors, scribbly lines), which makes me feel like an infant listening to Google telling me the story of Santa Claus. I said that the manipulative and simplified nature of this video is an insult to the intellect of web developers. The things Barb is saying in this video are simply unbelievable and manipulative. I commented on her tallking about "cross-site tracking mechanisms that weren't designed with privacy in mind". I asked if she was refering to Google Analytics, Google DNS or Google's retargeting. I asked her if "a healty eco-system" was actually a "healty paycheck". We know that Google is all about profiling, making billions with it. She must know this too. Lying to us about this in public feels very wrong. I said that she looked nice but that amorality was not looking good on her. I said that Google is not helping the web further and that the world does not need Google.

My comment was very critical, harsh if you will. But (to my defense) I am very passionate about this topic. I think Google is destroying the web/world with its monopoly on search, browser and mobile OS and the way they try to monetize that monopoly. Sure, I was attacking Barb personally, but I had good reason to doubt her honesty and intentions. I think people need a mirror every now and then. Me too. In the end a business is nothing more than a group of people, each of them with their own beliefs. People can change. Attacking them might not be the smartest approach... but maybe it plants a seed.

However, Google decided to remove my message immediately. This message cannot be removed. I reposted it on my personal blog and will repost it here as often as I have to. I wonder if this is what the next step of Googles monopoly looks like: censorship. I think it is awful! I think the discussion about morality and ethics is essential and should not be censored. Controlling the public opinion with censorshop is even worse than massively invading people's privacy. 

Google, you have outdone yourself. You are making me sick to my stomach!"
