title: Google makes me sick
---

I posted a critical comment under this Keynote "What's new in Chrome". I got deleted immediately by the Google team, which made me write the comment below instead.

But first some context. We are talking about this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2U9-R-OJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2U9-R-OJs).

"Why is my reaction gone? I said something critical about Google losing income due to the massive amount of privacy rules, ad blockers and browsers blocking cookies and cross site requests by default. This is the real reason why Google is changing its profiling strategy. They do not really care about privacy. The other thing I said is that this video is having a childish design on purpose (simplified look, bright colors, scribbly lines), which makes me feel like an infant listening to Google telling me the story of Santa Claus. I also said that the people in this video should really reconsider their purpose on this planet. Is this Google censorship? Awful! Controlling the public opinion like that is even worse than massively invading people's privacy. Google, you are making me sick to my stomach!"
