title: Google makes me sick
---

I posted a critical comment under this Keynote "What's new in Chrome". I got deleted immediately by the Google team, which made me write the comment below instead. But first some context. We are talking about [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2U9-R-OJs).

"Why is my reaction gone? What is it that you do not want people to read?

I said something critical about Google losing income due to the massive amount of privacy rules, ad blockers and browsers blocking cookies and cross site requests by default. I said that this was the real reason why Google is changing its profiling strategy. They do not really care about privacy. The other thing I said is that this video is having a childish design on purpose (simplified look, bright colors, scribbly lines), which makes me feel like an infant listening to Google telling me the story of Santa Claus. I said that it was an insult to the intellect of web developers. I also said that the people in this video should really reconsider their purpose on this planet, especially Barb. The things she is saying in this video are simply unbelievable and manipulative. Google is all about profiling and she knows it. I said that she looked nice but that amorality was not looking good on her. I said that she should consider a job that really mattered, like teaching kids how to read or write or make art. I said that Google is not helping the web further and that the world does not need Google.

My comment was very critical, but I personally thought that it was not crossing any lines. However Google decided to remove my message immediately. This message cannot be removed. I reposted it on my personal blog and will repost it here as often as I have to.

Is this what Googles monopoly resulted in? Censorship? Awful! Controlling the public opinion like that is even worse than massively invading people's privacy. Google, you are making me sick to my stomach!"
