title: Google makes me sick
---

I posted a critical comment under this Keynote video of the Chrome Dev Summit "What's new in Chrome". I got deleted immediately by the Google team, which made me write the comment below instead. But first some context. We are talking about [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2U9-R-OJs). Watched it? This was my reaction (that got 'flagged' and is no longer visible online):

"Why is my reaction gone?

I said something critical about Google losing income due to the massive amount of privacy rules, ad blockers and browsers blocking cookies and cross site requests by default. I said that this was the real reason why Google is changing its profiling strategy. They do not really care about privacy. The other thing I said is that this video is having a childish design on purpose (simplified look, bright colors, scribbly lines), which makes me feel like an infant listening to Google telling me the story of Santa Claus. I said that the manipulative and simplified nature of this video is an insult to the intellect of web developers. The things Barb is saying in this video are very manipulative. I commented on her talking about "cross-site tracking mechanisms that weren't designed with privacy in mind". I asked if she was refering to Google Analytics, Google DNS or Google's retargeting. I asked her if "a healty eco-system" was actually a "healty paycheck". We know that Google is all about profiling, making billions with it. She knows this too, which makes the things she and the way she said them wrong. I said that Google is not helping the web further and that the world does not need Google.

My comment was very critical, harsh if you will. But (to my defense) I am very passionate about this topic. I think Google is destroying the web/world with its monopoly on search, browser and mobile OS and the way they try to monetize it. They are creating content silo's in which they profile and target people (and apparently censor opinions too). We all know this creates distorted world views and fuels extremism, but nobody is stopping them. Sure, I was attacking Barb personally, but I had good reason to doubt her honesty and intentions. I think people need a mirror every now and then. Me too. In the end a business is nothing more than a group of people, each of them with their own beliefs. People can change. Attacking them might not be the smartest approach... but maybe it plants a seed.

However, Google decided to remove my message immediately, which are normally tactics of non-democratic regimes to manipulate people. This message cannot be removed. I reposted it on my personal blog. I think censorshp is awful! I think the discussion about morality and ethics is essential and should not be censored. Controlling the public opinion with censorshop is even worse than massively invading people's privacy. Critisism (valid or invalid) should be fought with arguments and intellect, not with censorship.

Google, you have outdone yourself. You have made me sick to my stomach!"
