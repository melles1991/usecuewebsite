title: Building websites in rem
---

Although I can almost build a website in my sleep (or in [20 minutes](/blog/speaking-at-jekyllconf2019/)), I am not talking about REM sleep or Rapid Eye Movement, but about 'root em'. 

I used to build websites in pixels, but I have chosen to abandon pixels and to completely swap to *em*, and the be more specific *root em*. Forty percent of all pages use *root em* in some way, according to the [HTTP Archive Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/css#units), so you are probably familiar with the abbreviation 'rem'.

The 'em' is a fascinating unit/measurement. It originates from the height of the metal body of a letter in a letterpress and its name comes from its relation to the width of the captial letter 'M'. In this digital era this relation has blurred. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)), an average font might have a cap height of 70% of the *em*, and an x-height of 48% of the *em*. 'Root' means that the size of the *em* is related to the font-size of the root element, which it the HTML element of your web page.

Here is how it works: If you set your font-size to 20px on the HTML element, 1 *root em* will equal 20 pixels. So, *root em* equals the root font-size. A pixel becomes 1/20th by 1/20th *root em* big. A larger font could have a font-size of 2 *root em* (40px) and your body text could be 0.8 *root em* (16px). And a nice extra: even media queries can be defined in *root em*.

So if *root em* is nothing more than a multiplier, why should you use it? Well... only for one reason actually: it makes simulating browser zoom much easier. A common media query that takes advantage of this would be: if the screen is narrower than 600 pixels (30rem), bump the font-size of the HTML element up to 22 pixels. This media query will show your website at 110% scale, with just a single line of CSS.

Sounds great, but is it worth the extra effort? I think it is. I got used to this new approach quickly and it soon felt as easy as using pixels. Situation in which I find this approach extremely helpful are: handling very large and very small screen sizes and Google or a designer wanting to change the chosen website width or font-size.
